# Logic-Building & DSA Practice

### 📌 Introduction

Welcome to my **Logic-Building & DSA Practice Repository** — a collection of **530+ coding programs** written during offline practice sessions. This repository is not just a collection of codes but a reflection of my consistent journey in **problem-solving, logic building, and self-discipline**.

Every program here represents an effort to sharpen programming fundamentals — starting from basic logic to gradually solving more complex problems.

### 🛠️ What This Repository Represents

👉 Consistent hands-on practice across various programming concepts.\
👉 Progression from **brute force** to **optimized solutions** wherever possible.\
👉 Clear code with comments explaining the thought process.\
👉 A self-made archive reflecting **pure practice without shortcuts**.

### 🔑 Topics Covered

### 💻 Languages Used

- **C++**: For mastering core logic and DSA.
- **Java**: For object-oriented and advanced concepts.

### 🔥 Why This Repository Matters

This repository stands as proof of my **dedication towards becoming a better programmer** — where every code is a brick in the wall of my learning journey. It's not about just storing programs — it's about showing how consistent practice shapes logical thinking day by day.

### 🌐 How to Navigate

Programs are stored as individual files without strict folder modularization — maintaining the **raw sequence of practice** exactly as it happened. Each code contains comments for better understanding.

### 💪 Conclusion

This is more than just code — it's a silent story of **perseverance, logic, and self-improvement**. As I continue this journey, the repository will keep growing — one program at a time.
